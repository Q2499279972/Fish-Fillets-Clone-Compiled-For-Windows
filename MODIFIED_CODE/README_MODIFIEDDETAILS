It need lower version lua, so I used version 5.1.5.
I did not install this lua to my compile enviroment.
It is enough, if have liblua.a
I moved the lua header files to this directory.
lua is very easy to build...
So, modified MakeFile.

And
BINDIR = /usr/local/bin
DATADIR = /usr/local/share/ff-clone
is modified.

directories.c is modified to change the directory to keep saves.
